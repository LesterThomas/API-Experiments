# Angular-JSONLD

This is a test Angular application using the Angular-jsonld module against a simple set of test APIs (actually static JSON-LD documents).
The experiment shows:
1. Binding to semantics of different formats of JDON-LD with different syntax.
2. Linking from a JSON-LD document to 4 others.


The experiment is based on https://github.com/io-informatics/angular-jsonld


## Build & development
